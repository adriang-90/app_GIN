## In this app I am going to use **GitFlow** development style. Why?

According to
[this](https://www.toptal.com/software/trunk-based-development-git-flow)
great article:

1. Use it when you run open source project -> It is a public repo in
   Github
2. When you have a lot of junior developrs -> **ME**, **MYSELF** and
   **I**
3. When you have an established product -> Meh that's not the case but
   it does not matter

## What is GitFlow?
